# wordpress-export-file-improver
This application can resolve duplicate post and media titles, and fix incorrect importing of images, for WordPress export files.

This application was developed as I was facing these problems when importing a WordPress blog. Some of the other tools that I found invaluable during this process included:

RangerPretzel's WXR File Splitter:

(for splitting export files larger than the server can handle)

Better Search Replace plugin: 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-search-replace/
(for replacing image URLs referenced in posts)
